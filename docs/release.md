# Release Control Surface

Jeryu releases are local-first and evidence-backed. A release candidate cannot
be signed from hosted CI state alone.
This is the canonical release process doc for version source, changelog,
release commands, integrity/provenance evidence, and rollback guidance.
The step-by-step operator process lives in `docs/release-process.md`.

Release process documentation: [docs/release-process.md](release-process.md).
That document is the executable operator release process doc for required
local gates, PR-backed publication metadata, receipt contents, tagging, and
rollback.
SignRail artifact-support signing details:
[docs/signrail-release-signing.md](signrail-release-signing.md).

## Release Structure

The release structure is intentionally artifact-backed:

- Version source: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `jeryu-wsversion`.
- Changelog source: `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Release process doc: `docs/release-process.md`.
- Release control surface: `docs/release.md`.
- CI or script evidence: `target/ci-fast/publish.json` and `target/jankurai/`.
- Integrity and provenance evidence: `target/artifact-support/signrail/`.
- Production env and atomicsoul deploy handoff:
  `ops/deploy/make-production-env.sh` and
  `ops/deploy/sign-and-push-atomicsoul.sh`.
- Rollback guidance: `docs/release.md#rollback`.

### Governed Jankurai identity

Release and score lanes consume Jankurai only through `ops/ci/lib.sh`. The
release-authoritative source is the local Jeryu tag
`v1.6.11-deadlang-precision-split.1`; the installed binary must report
`jankurai 1.6.11` and match SHA-256
`fdb42e5fa7d9851c0729e59bf1e582c895aa9cfc03a7175b420c6025d2fd014e`.
The verifier rejects missing files, symlinks, version drift, byte substitution,
and missing or mismatched content-addressed installation receipts. It
deterministically neutralizes an earlier ambient PATH entry by prepending the
governed binary directory and then verifying the resulting resolution; it does
not claim the initial PATH was rejected. The embedded API bridge additionally
rejects multi-link files and validates the complete local source, build, and
protected jeryu-tool manifest authority before publishing a score. Verification
never installs or fetches a tool, and GitHub is neither release authority nor a
dependency of this verification path.

The former 1.6.10 score is preserved byte-identically under
`agent/baselines/historical/` as audit history. The active ratchet remains
fail-closed until a fresh 1.6.11 baseline is generated on protected `main` and
independently reviewed; candidate-branch output cannot become its own baseline.

## Version Source

- `jeryu-wsversion` owns workspace version decisions. `decide` classifies the
  commit range, `apply` rewrites only `[workspace.package].version` and
  `CHANGELOG.md`, and `inherit-guard` rejects member manifests that pin their
  own version.
- Rust crate versions live in the root workspace manifest and `Cargo.lock`;
  workspace members must use `version.workspace = true`.
- User-facing changes are summarized in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Release candidates record the Git commit SHA, artifact checksums, SBOM
  digests, and rollback target.
- SignRail artifact-support evidence uses the Git commit SHA as its release
  version unless the caller sets `SIGNRAIL_RELEASE_VERSION`.

### Main Ref Authority And Version Bridge

Local and external Git clients cannot push directly to `refs/heads/main`.
They must publish a branch and merge through Jeryu's PR path. After the merge
passport, CI, head-SHA, and branch-protection checks pass, Jeryu may advance
`main` server-side through the protected ref service; this is not a receive-pack
bypass, direct push, or force update.

When an authorized server-side update advances `refs/heads/main`, the API bridge
runs `jeryu-wsversion` in a temporary clone of the bare repo. It decides the
bump from the landed range, applies the root workspace version and changelog
update, and commits `chore(release): vX [skip-version]`. The bridge advances
local `main` with a compare-and-swap `update-ref` from the exact main SHA that
triggered the bridge to the generated bump commit. If `main` moved meanwhile,
the CAS fails and the duplicate bump is discarded.

This bridge does not tag, sign, publish artifacts, or bypass the PR-backed
release process. It only keeps the workspace version source aligned after local
`main` advances. The `[skip-version]` marker is the recursion guard: the
generated release commit is evidence for the next release receipt, but it does
not trigger another version bump.

## Required Gates

- `bash ci-fast-push.sh --full --no-push`
- `JERYU_CI_PROFILE=github JERYU_CI_USE_SCCACHE=0 bash ci-fast-push.sh --full --no-push`
- `bash scripts/ci-phases.sh`
- `./ops/ci/full.sh`
- `SIGNRAIL_ROLLBACK_TARGET=<previous-signed-release> bash ops/ci/artifact_support.sh`
- `bash ops/ci/release.sh`
- `bash ops/deploy/test-atomicsoul-release.sh` when atomicsoul deploy helpers
  or production deployment docs change.
- `just security`
- `just audit`
- `bash ops/ci/proof-evidence.sh`
- `bash ops/ci/test-governed-jankurai.sh`
- `cargo test -p jeryu-runnerd workcell --jobs 40` when the workcell control plane, tar safety, or CI repair snapshot helpers change.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-readmodel -p jeryu-tui --jobs 40` when the workcells,
  agent-runs, codegraph/oracle dashboard, or TUI projection contract changes.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-readmodel --jobs 40 && cd apps/web && npm run typecheck` when the generated web bootstrap contract changes.
- `cd apps/web && npm run ux-qa` when the SPA's rendered surface changes; the
  Playwright HTML report it checks is suppressed by the rtk command wrapper, so
  produce it with `rtk proxy npx playwright test` first.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40` when compatibility routes
  or guided repair bodies change.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 r5_jail_loop` when the
  jailed workcell edit, namespaced branch export, PR creation, or CI evidence
  flow changes.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 workcell_run_agent` when
  the workcell run-agent route, typed path denial, structured event response, or
  sandbox-unavailable repair evidence changes.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 agent_runs` when the
  high-level live agent-run route, PTY controls, failed-CI repair source, or
  typed control denials change.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 workcell_export_slice`
  when workcell export gating, `jeryu-codegraph`, or the export PR changed-file
  derivation changes. The release receipt must include the typed denial evidence
  proving an out-of-slice diff creates no pull request.
- `bash ops/ci/codegraph-oracle.sh` when the codegraph schema, MCP catalog,
  oracle impact-pack contract, or `/api/v1/repos/{id}/codegraph/query` facade
  changes.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 control_plane`,
  `cargo test -p jeryu-mcp --jobs 40`,
  `cargo test -p jeryu-cli --jobs 40`, and
  `npm --workspace @jeryu/web run typecheck && npm --workspace @jeryu/web run test`
  when the JMCP control-plane REST, MCP, CLI, or `/intelligence` web surface
  changes.
- `cargo clippy -p jeryu-api --features web --all-targets --jobs 40 -- -D warnings`
  when public API response contracts, `/api/v1/ecosystem`, or
  `/api/v1/ci/runs/{id}/evidence` change. Evidence digest or canonicalization
  changes must attach the route test transcript, clippy transcript, and
  Jankurai audit score to the release receipt.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-signrail --test release_witness`,
  `cargo test -p jeryu-signrail --jobs 40 verify_release`, and
  `cargo clippy -p jeryu-signrail --all-targets -- -D warnings` when release
  signing, release verification, artifact provenance, witness, or stage-receipt
  behavior changes.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-wsversion --jobs 40`,
  `cargo run -q -p jeryu-wsversion -- inherit-guard`, and
  `cargo run -q -p jeryu-wsversion -- decide --range origin/main..HEAD --json`
  when workspace versioning, changelog roll-forward, or release version source
  behavior changes.
- `cargo run -p jeryu-sandbox-linux --example jail_demo` and
  `cargo test -p jeryu-runnerd jailgun` when the workcell cell jail (the
  `jeryu-sandbox-linux` launch path) or the jailgun tar validators change.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-agentbridge` and `cargo test -p jeryu-egress` when the
  in-cell agent driver or the allowlist egress proxy changes.
  Workcell- and jailed-agent-authored changes flow through these same release
  gates and CI evidence with no privileged path; see `docs/workcell.md`.
- `cargo test -p jeryu-sandbox-linux` (escape_suite + cgroup_confinement +
  secret_paths_denied + memory_oom_kill) when the sandbox cgroup/Landlock
  enforcement or `ops/security/jeryu-runnerd.service` delegation unit changes —
  agent jobs must stay fail-closed on resource caps and the jail must keep
  denying secret/other-repo reads.
- `bash ops/ci/coverage.sh` when workcell crate tests change: it enforces the
  per-crate src-coverage ratchet (`ops/ci/coverage-baseline.json`) over
  `jeryu-api`, `jeryu-egress`, and `jeryu-codegraph`. Coverage may not drop below
  the recorded floor; raise it deliberately with
  `JERYU_COVERAGE_UPDATE_BASELINE=1` and commit the updated baseline.

### Public Portal Auth Hardening

When public portal auth, repository grants, source browsing, or split-browser
behavior changes, the release receipt must include:

- migration evidence for `jeryu-core/db/migrations/0008_user_auth_access.sql`
  and its rollback note. Take a pre-migration SQLite copy with `VACUUM INTO`;
  rollback for populated stores is restore-from-copy, not deleting credential
  rows in place.
- bootstrap credential handling evidence: generated bootstrap/admin-reset
  passwords are temporary, first login must change them, and reset revokes the
  user's existing sessions and personal access tokens.
- local-dev trust evidence: `trust_local_dev` is valid only for loopback peers,
  and server startup fails if it is combined with a public bind address.
- token/session evidence: cookie-auth unsafe API requests require
  `X-Jeryu-CSRF`; bearer/PAT clients are exempt; new PATs default to a 90-day
  expiry and cannot exceed 365 days.
- route proof: `cargo test -p jeryu-core --jobs 40 auth`,
  `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 auth`,
  `cargo test -p jeryu-api --features web --jobs 40 github`, and
  `npm --workspace @jeryu/web run typecheck && npm --workspace @jeryu/web run test`.
- rendered proof for the split browser and auth gate:
  `npm --workspace @jeryu/web run test:e2e` plus
  `npm --workspace @jeryu/web run ux-qa` when the browser surface changes.

## Release Receipt

Every final release receipt is `jeryu.release-receipt/v2`. It is built from
signed-commit provenance and fails closed unless the candidate is safe to tag:

- source commit SHA, tag name, `signed-commit.txt`, and a locally successful
  `git verify-commit --raw <sha>` transcript;
- publication metadata from `target/ci-fast/publish.json`, written by the
  PR-backed `ci-fast-push.sh` publish path, including branch, base, PR URL,
  PR number, and commit;
- previous signed release artifact evidence: release tag, `jeryu` checksum,
  `jeryu.sig` checksum, and `jeryu.pem` checksum;
- `target/jankurai/` proof artifacts, including the release lane transcript,
  SBOM digests, provenance checksum, and any API route evidence for changed
  endpoints;
- MCP/catalog trust evidence for changed local agent-facing commands:
  `agent/tool-adoption.toml`, the pinned `ops/ci/security-tools.sh` transcript,
  `cargo test -p jeryu-mcp --test mcp_conformance --jobs 40`, and any composed
  route/tool contract lane such as `bash ops/ci/codegraph-oracle.sh`;
- the `jeryu-wsversion decide --json` output for the released range, plus
  inherit-guard evidence proving every workspace member inherits the root
  version;
- `artifact-support-evidence.tar.gz` plus SignRail `release.json`,
  `sbom.json`, `provenance.json`, `witness.json`, `summary.json`, and
  `stage-receipts/{local,dev-canary,prod}.json`, copied into the release bundle
  under `artifact-support-signrail/`;
- migration, restore, and rollback evidence, including the exact rollback
  target and the pre-migration SQLite copy when schema changed;
- `SHA256SUMS`, generated by `scripts/emit-release-receipt.sh` over every
  bundle file except `release-receipt.json` and `SHA256SUMS` itself; the
  receipt records the checksum manifest digest.

Release receipts must include current local-native and GitHub-clean full-mode
transcripts rather than historical score claims. The GitHub-clean proof command
is
`JERYU_CI_PROFILE=github JERYU_CI_USE_SCCACHE=0 bash ci-fast-push.sh --full --no-push`.
Full mode runs `ops/ci/verify-jeryu-env.sh --build-local --release-guard` and
accepts either the canonical GitHub remote or the loopback local Jeryu remote on
`127.0.0.1:8787`. It rejects retired-provider runners, stale `~/.jeryu`
binaries, old `/home/ubuntu/jeryu`, and local `:2224` listener/remotes so
release evidence cannot be produced against the retired system. The local API
install under `~/.jeryu/bin/jeryu-api` is accepted only when it byte-matches the
repo-built API binary. Retired-CI sweeps of additional source roots run only
when `JERYU_CI_SOURCE_ROOTS` is set.

## Release Process

1. Run the required gates locally and keep the emitted artifacts under
   `target/jankurai/` until the release receipt is signed.
2. Verify the SQLite migration and restore receipts for the candidate commit.
3. For public API additions, attach the route-level test commands and response
   contract evidence, including typed repair fields and any digest-verifiable
   payload contract.
   Workcell run-agent additions must include the typed path-denial evidence and
   either structured event output or honest sandbox-unavailable evidence.
   Agent-run additions must include live PTY event/control evidence and typed
   denial evidence for stale, finished, or unsupported control paths.
   Codegraph oracle additions must include `bash ops/ci/codegraph-oracle.sh`.
   JMCP control-plane additions must include route tests for explicit mirror
   and artifact absence, MCP catalog evidence, CLI grammar evidence, and web
   route smoke for `/intelligence`.
4. Build only from a signed commit. `scripts/emit-release-receipt.sh` verifies
   the commit with `git verify-commit --raw <sha>` and writes the transcript to
   `signed-commit.txt`.
5. Sign artifact-support evidence with `jeryu-signrail sign-release` through
   `bash ops/ci/artifact_support.sh`. Set `SIGNRAIL_ROLLBACK_TARGET` to the
   previous signed release tag; local runs require `JERYU_SIGNRAIL_ED25519_SEED`,
   and GitHub Actions requires `SIGNRAIL_ED25519_SEED`.
6. Publish through the PR-backed `ci-fast-push.sh` path before tagging:
   `bash ci-fast-push.sh --full` from a release branch pushes the branch, opens
   or reports the PR, and writes `target/ci-fast/publish.json`. Direct `main`
   pushes require explicit `--push-main`; final receipts reject that metadata
   unless `JERYU_RELEASE_DIRECT_MAIN_ESCAPE=1` is also set.
7. Run `bash ops/ci/release.sh`. It preflights the signed commit and
   `target/ci-fast/publish.json`, runs `ops/ci/artifact_support.sh` if the
   signed artifact-support evidence is not already present, copies that
   evidence into the bundle, records binary/SBOM/provenance/cosign digests,
   writes `rollback.json`, emits `release-receipt.json`, and writes
   `SHA256SUMS`.
8. For production deploys, generate fresh per-release env material with
   `ops/deploy/make-production-env.sh --release <release-tag>`, source the
   generated `production.env`, and push the signed artifact handoff with
   `ops/deploy/sign-and-push-atomicsoul.sh --env <production.env>`. This writes
   and Ed25519-signs `target/release/bundle/atomicsoul-deploy/SHA256SUMS`,
   pushes the bundle/web/manifest/runtime env to `atomicsoul`, and verifies the
   checksum manifest and signature on the host. It does not restart the service
   unless `--restart` is supplied.
   For a first production install with no previous artifact on the host, set
   `JERYU_RELEASE_INITIAL_DEPLOY=1` and use a concrete rollback marker such as
   `atomicsoul-initial-install` for both `SIGNRAIL_ROLLBACK_TARGET` and
   `JERYU_RELEASE_ROLLBACK_TAG`.
9. Tag only after the v2 receipt names the exact signed commit, PR publication
   path, prior signed rollback artifact, stage receipts, and checksum manifest.

## Autonomy Gate

`jeryu/autonomy` check-runs are release evidence only. They record whether a PR
head is CI/risk eligible, human-required, or blocked, but they do not merge.
Release receipts must treat `Neutral` autonomy verdicts as advisory until the
auto-merge safety rework has explicit author/fork trust, signed reviewer
verification, populated changed-file evidence, and head-pinned merge tests.

## Integrity And Provenance

The security lane writes SBOM, vulnerability scan, provenance, and signing
artifacts under `target/jankurai/security/sbom`. Final release receipts require
the SPDX SBOM checksum, CycloneDX checksum, provenance checksum, and cosign
transcript checksum.

## Rollback

Every release receipt names the previous signed artifact, binary checksum,
signature checksum, and certificate checksum. Rollback means restoring the
previous signed artifact, restoring the pre-migration SQLite copy when schema
changed, and re-running the smoke commands for API, TUI, and Git fetch/clone
before reopening write traffic.
For SignRail artifact-support evidence, rollback also requires the prior
stage-receipt set and matching artifact digest so `prod` receipts never point
at an unsigned or unverifiable bundle.

## Local-Only Boundary

The current live runtime is bound to `127.0.0.1`. LAN or public exposure waits
for auth, TLS, token rotation, backup restore evidence, and abuse-control
receipts.

## Production Readiness

Production launch is gated behind the local-only boundary above. When the
server moves off `127.0.0.1`, the launch checklist is:

- **Launch / production rollout:** promote only a signed, gate-green commit;
  deploy behind the unified `jeryu serve` listener; canary one node, widen on
  green, and keep the prior signed artifact staged for rollback.
- **Atomicsoul handoff:** each production release gets fresh env material and a
  fresh deploy signing key from `ops/deploy/make-production-env.sh`. The
  artifact bundle must be pushed with
  `ops/deploy/sign-and-push-atomicsoul.sh`, which verifies the signed SHA
  manifest on `atomicsoul` before updating `~/.jeryu` symlinks.
- **Rate limiting:** the GitHub-shaped edge emits `X-RateLimit-*` headers
  already; enforce per-token rate limits and abuse-control 429s before any
  public exposure.
- **Monitoring:** scrape the `system.health` WS channel plus the runner-pool /
  queue read-model for liveness, queue depth, stuck nodes, and tag starvation;
  alert on `safe_to_merge=false` and sustained failed-job ratios.
- **Backup / restore:** snapshot the SQLite forge store and the gitd bare-repo
  root on a schedule; the rollback receipt above names the exact restore target.
