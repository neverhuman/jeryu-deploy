# Architecture

Jeryu is a local GitHub-compatible forge implemented as Rust workspace crates and local operational scripts. Compatibility means matching observable API and workflow behavior where that is useful for users and agents; it does not mean copying GitHub source, bundling GitHub assets, or requiring a hosted GitHub dependency.

This checkout owns source only for `crates/jeryu-api`, `crates/jeryu-cli`, and
`crates/jeryu-split-tool`. Core, Git storage, CI, runner, cache, proof, agent,
codegraph, and signing packages are immutable Git dependencies owned by their
standalone repositories. Deploy may exercise their public contracts through
its API/CLI graph, but it must not present their source gates as local source.
See `docs/codegraph-oracle.md` for the composed codegraph contract.

The shared workcell control plane is part of the runner/CI stack, not a separate subsystem. `jeryu-runnerd` owns warm-pool claims, epoch-fenced release/heartbeat handling, startup rebase enforcement, and quarantine-first tar validation on top of the existing runner fabric.

Deploy's agent-run edge keeps one wire-type and routing authority in
`web/agent_runs.rs`. Child modules isolate HTTP/MCP/driver orchestration,
bounded run and raw-TTY state, and frozen-diff pull-request export. They expose
only the same `web`-scoped surface as the former single file; persistence,
runner authority, and serialized contracts remain owned by their existing
components.

The API keeps the same module and route authority while isolating split-family
catalog loading, bootstrap credential custody, session runtime preparation,
repository source reads, pull-request merge posture, and installed Jankurai
verification in child modules. The HTTP and MCP edges both apply one bounded
`x-request-id` middleware: portable caller IDs round-trip, while empty, hostile,
or oversized values are replaced before handlers observe them.

The R5 proof lane lives in `crates/jeryu-api` and closes the loop from claim to reviewed pull request: rebase, jailed edit, namespaced branch export, PR creation, and CI evidence verification. The export request carries the changed-file list so the pull request preserves branch ownership and reviewer-visible edit scope.

JMCP/control-plane intelligence is an API/read-model boundary over local truth:
the local forge store, runner fabric, workcells, agent runs, codegraph, and
tool-build clusters are authoritative, while GitHub mirror data is optional
read-only evidence that must degrade as `missing`, `stale`, `queued`, `failed`,
or `unknown` rather than becoming an implicit green signal.

The canonical reproducible validation surfaces are `Justfile`, `ops/ci/*.sh`,
`ops/ci/gates/*.sh`, and `agent/test-map.json`; protected hosted refs and the
exact-head required context are merge authority.

`tools/security-lane.sh` owns the security implementation. Compatibility
callers may enter through `ops/ci/security.sh`, but that file delegates without
reimplementing checks; the comprehensive and pull-request gates enable network
dependency audits explicitly.

## Standalone Delivery Authority

This split repository composes immutable sibling releases into the API and CLI
delivery graph. It consumes the governed Jankurai identity rendered from the
protected `jeryu-tool` manifest, but it never issues, signs, or silently
substitutes that identity. The release-broker path is a deployment boundary:
release CI must resolve the single physical broker binary before any score or
artifact decision is trusted.
