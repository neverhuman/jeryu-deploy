# What it does, in order:
#   1. Install (pinned) cargo-llvm-cov + cargo-mutants if missing. If an install
#      genuinely fails in this environment we DO NOT fake green: we write a
#      skip-with-receipt under target/coverage/ and exit non-zero with code 3 so
#      the gate wrapper can render PENDING (never silent PASS).
#   2. cargo llvm-cov over the five critical engine crates -> target/llvm-cov/lcov.info
#      (line_coverage source `rust-lcov` in agent/coverage-sources.toml).
#   3. cargo-mutants SCOPED to a single critical crate with a hard --timeout
#      (mutants over the full 50-crate workspace is far too slow) ->
#      target/mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json (mirrored to
#      target/mutants/outcomes.json; mutation source `rust-mutation`).
#   4. jankurai coverage audit over agent/coverage-sources.toml, and assert the
#      reported HARD finding count is 0.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  -> artifacts produced, audit ran, hard==0.
#   1  -> a real failure (artifact produced but hard>0, or audit/parse error).
#   3  -> a required external tool could not be installed here; skip-with-receipt
#         was written. The gate wrapper maps this to PENDING, not FAIL.
