# Real-engine smoke for the confined agent-sandbox image.
#
# It BUILDS the image and runs the hardened container with the EXACT lock-down flags
# `OciSpec::from_agent_job` (crates/jeryu-runner-oci) emits, then PROVES the lockdown
# actually holds on a live engine: read-only root, --network none, the refusal wrappers,
# the seccomp symlink block, the git guard, and the in-image toolchain. Each property is
# one container run with a clear pass/fail line.
#
# Usage:  ops/agent-sandbox/smoke.sh [smoke|full]
# Engine: ${JERYU_OCI_RUNTIME:-podman} (matches the runner's runtime selection).
#
# When no container engine is present the script prints a clear SKIP line and exits 0, so
# it is safe to invoke from any lane; the assertions only run where an engine exists (a
# dedicated runner). The daemonless CI never reaches the engine path.
